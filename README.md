![Laptop Screenshot](./docs/images/misc/laptop.png)

Hai.ku is a minimalist microblogging app, by constraining the content of posts to the 5-7-5 syllable haiku structure it challenges the user to express themselves within such a laconic form. The project was inspired by the original 140 character limit on twitter and the  Lars von Trier, JÃ¸rgen Leth film [The Five Obstructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Obstructions).

#### Design

Given the simplicity and clarity of the haiku form, it feels natural that the website design should be likewise minimal and unobtrusive, as such I have opted for a  clear style and an easy to read font, I had originally planned to use a light theme but after accessibility testing I changed the styling to a darker blue hued theme for easier legibility and reduced eye-strain.

## Database Structure

#### Essential Schema

The core of the microblog uses two models profile and post.

##### Profile

The custom profile model extends the default user model supplied by django with fields for a user bio and user uploaded profile image hosted using Cloudinary. As it depends upon the user model it is created when the user model is created and similarly updated when the user is updated using the `@reciever` decorator in the model definition. It also is deleted if the corresponding user is deleted

| field       | value                                                | explanation            |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| user        | models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE) | instance of user model |
| bio         | models.TextField(max_length=500, blank=True)         | text field for bio     |
| profile_pic | CloudinaryField('image', default='placeholder')      | cloud hosted image     |

##### Post

The post model represents the users posts. It is linked to the posters profile and will be deleted upon deletion of the the posters profile, it also contains information on the posts creation date

| field      | value                                                                                 | explanation                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| body       | models.TextField()                                                                    | content of the post                  |
| created_at | models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)                                               | timestamp when post was created      |
| author     | models.ForeignKey('profiles.Profile', on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='posts') | link to profile that created the post |

##### Likes

The Likes model saves when a user likes a post

| Field | Value | Explanation |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| user | ForeignKey('profiles.Profile') | References the Profile model that created the like. Uses CASCADE deletion to remove likes when a user is deleted. |
| post | ForeignKey('Post') | References the Post being liked. Uses CASCADE deletion to remove likes when a post is deleted. Has a related_name of 'likes_set' for reverse lookups. |
| created_at | DateTimeField | Automatically set when the like is created (auto_now_add=True). Records when the like was made. |
| Meta class | unique_together = ('user', 'post') | Ensures a user can only like a post once by preventing duplicate combinations of user and post. |

## Agile Methodologies

#### Acceptance Criteria/User Stories
After the initial ideation I wrote a few possible user stories and using microsoft copilot I refined these rough sketches into actionable task lists, with acceptance criteria and what tasks needed to be done to meet them. These were then added to a Kanban Board.

#### Kanban Board
[associated project board](https://github.com/users/w1zzball/projects/7)
To help streamline design and pinpoint key features I employed a Kanban Board to track my progress and used the MoSCoW prioritisation method to sort tasks by how essential they were to the minimum viable product. This was implemented using github's built in project boards, using custom labels to sort which items were must have/should have/could haves.

## Use of AI

Github's Copilot AI was used to give suggestions for features or improvements, these were then refined and implemented. Here are some examples of how AI was utilised:
- **Regex generation** : Copilot was used to help generate regular expressions for the sanitization of user submitted data for use in SEO metadata tags.
- **Debugging** : Copilot helped identify cases where seemingly correct code did not function because elements were being accessed before creation, necessitating a change in load order or the use of guards.
- **Suggestion of novel methods** : Asking for advice on the implementation of post creation, copilot suggested using AJAX to implement dynamic loading of new elements without full page refreshes. I had no experience with the XHR API and after consulting the MDN documentation and some guides I implemented the post CRUD functionality with AJAX. Using copilot to diagnose and troubleshoot errors as I learnt. 
- **Generating model data** : To test the like, profile view and post feeds I needed multiple database entries. Manually creating these would have been tedious and as such I instead dumped my database into a json file which I then gave as context to copilot with a prompt to construct suitable test data. The test data was then loaded back into the database allowing me to test for problems with larger scale data interacting with templates etc.
- **Generating test data** : To test the haiku validation code I wrote a main guard entrypoint into the haiku_helpers.py module which would take test haiku and log out validation results. To test this I used Microsoft's Copilot web app to generate larger sets of haiku which I then fed into the validator and based on the results I refined the validator for edge cases.
- **Refactoring CSS** : As my project grew larger, the single stylesheet I had been using began to grow to cumbersome size, I decided to refactor the stylesheet into multiple modular components, each responsible for a specific aspect of the app; which could then be included only where necessary. I prompted Copilot to split up my styles.css file into a few components "base", "posts", "profiles" etc. It then copied the relevant parts of the stylesheet into their own modules. I then manually reviewed the new files to make sure no actual content had been changed and that the correct css rules where in the correct files.

      ```
      import os
      os.environ.setdefault("KEY","VALUE")
      ...
      ```
      key / values to supply
     - `SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key`
     - `DEBUG=foo #any non null value will enable debug mode as the settings.py file looks to see if any value exists.` 
     - `CLOUDINARY_URL=your_cloudinary_url`

## Credits

Without the help of the Code Institute staff none of this would be possible, In particular my thanks go out to my Course Mentor Alexander Tastad, Coding Coach John Rearden and Subject Matter Expert Kevin Loughrey. I would also like to thank the rest of the WECA2025 cohort for their insight, advice and most of all their camaraderie during the bootcamp
