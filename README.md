-Educators and Students: Teachers and learners interested in using the platform as a tool to explore creative writing, language, and the beauty of constraints.

#### User Stories

(Expanded on in [associated project board](https://github.com/users/w1zzball/projects/7))

- User Story: As a new user, I want to sign up and create an account so that I can start sharing my haikus.

- As a user, I want to create a haiku post so that I can share my thoughts and creativity with the community.

- As a user, I want to see a feed of haikus so that I can enjoy and engage with the creativity of others.

- As a user, I want to like haikus so that I can show appreciation for the posts I enjoy.

- As a user, I want to comment on haikus so that I can express my thoughts and engage with the creator.

- As a user, I want insights on the performance of my haikus so that I can understand which posts resonate most with others.

- As a user, I want to search for haikus by keywords, themes, or authors so that I can find specific content.

#### Design

Given the simplicity and clarity of the haiku form, it feels natural that the website design should be likewise minimal and unobtrusive, as such I have opted for a light and clear style and an easy to read font

#### Wireframes

Initial wireframes made using Balsamiq

##### Mobile

The site was designed using a mobile first approach

## Database Structure

#### Essential Schema

The core of the microblog uses two models profile and post.

##### Profile

The profile model extends the default user model supplied by django with fields for a user bio and user uploaded profile image hosted using Cloudinary. As it depends upon the user model it is created when the user model is created and similarly updated when the user is updated using the `@reciever` decorator in the model definition. It also is deleted if the corresponding user is deleted

| field       | value                                                | explanation            |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| user        | models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE) | instance of user model |
| bio         | models.TextField(max_length=500, blank=True)         | text field for bio     |
| profile_pic | CloudinaryField('image', default='placeholder')      | cloud hosted image     |

##### Post

The post model holds the users posts. It is linked to the posters profile and will be deleted upon deletion of the the posters profile, it also contains information on the posts creation date, and how many likes the post has

| field      | value                                                                                 | explanation                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| body       | models.TextField()                                                                    | content of the post                  |
| created_at | models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)                                               | timestamp when post was created      |
| author     | models.ForeignKey('profiles.Profile', on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='posts') | link to profile who created the post |
| likes      | models.PositiveIntegerField(default=0)                                                | number of likes on the post          |

##### Likes

The Likes model saves when a user likes a post

| Field | Value | Explanation |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| user | ForeignKey('profiles.Profile') | References the Profile model that created the like. Uses CASCADE deletion to remove likes when a user is deleted. |
| post | ForeignKey('Post') | References the Post being liked. Uses CASCADE deletion to remove likes when a post is deleted. Has a related_name of 'likes_set' for reverse lookups. |
| created_at | DateTimeField | Automatically set when the like is created (auto_now_add=True). Records when the like was made. |
| Meta class | unique_together = ('user', 'post') | Ensures a user can only like a post once by preventing duplicate combinations of user and post. |

## Agile Methodologies

#### Acceptance Criteria/User Stories
After the initial ideation I wrote a few possible user stories and using microsoft copilot I refined these rough sketches into actionable task lists, with acceptance criteria and what tasks needed to be done to meet them. These were then added to a Kanban Board.

#### Kanban Board
To help streamline design and pinpoint key features I employed a Kanban Board to track my progress and used the MoSCoW prioritisation method to sort tasks by how essential they were to the minimum viable product. This was impemented using githubs built in project boards, using custom labels to sort which items were must have/should have/could haves.

## Deployment

- deployed to heroku

---

## Testing

#### HTML

Running the home, account and post pages generated from my templates through the WC3 HTML validator returns no errors.

#### CSS

W3C CSS validator returns no errors on any of the static css components.

#### JavaScript

#### Python / Unit tests

#### Lighthouse

- The homepage recieves a greater than or equal to 99/100 on all lighthouse metrics
- Individual post urls recieve high (>92) scores on all lighthouse metrics barring 'best practices' which is penalised for the use of third party cookies which are being imported by cloudinary
- Profile pages likewise recieve high scores excepting for the cloudinary cookies dragging down the best practices score
- User Posts page recieves either 100 or high 90s as it does not include cloudinary content
